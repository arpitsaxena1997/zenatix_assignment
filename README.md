I have added new screenshots of timecharts in 'screenshotsOfTimeCharts' folder.

I have made timecharts(bar and line) for:     
    processes having CPU usage > 2 %;  
    processes having Memory usage > 2 %;  
    a combined graph of the above mentioned 2 graphs
    
    
The time stamp on x-axis is the number of seconds passed since epoch.

For Unix system, January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 at UTC is epoch (the point where time begins).
