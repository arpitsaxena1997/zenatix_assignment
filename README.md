The screenshots of graphs have very big names for pids on x-axis as pids were starting from pd "1 to pid "3952051".

I have also added screenshot of process details in screenshot folder.

I was having issues in uploading Docker containers on GITHUB because it was exceeding daily free limit of 1 GB.
The link to docker cntainers is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i_SfrG6PV3Amgi5nOUcVHMDg99Gm9K2M?usp=sharing
The docker containers were created after doing things normally. So, these docker containers only contains data in elastic search but they donot contain the dashboard of which screenshots are shared.
